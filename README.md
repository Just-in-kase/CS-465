<h1><strong>Travlr Getaways – Full Stack Web Application</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>

Travlr Getaways is a full stack web application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). The application supports two primary user experiences: a customer-facing travel booking site and a secure administrative single-page application (SPA). Customers can browse trips, view details, and review itineraries. Administrators can log in securely, create and edit trips, and manage booking data.
